Shopping Scheduler for the public in the case of a total Covid-19 Lockdown. 

## How it works
The public can access the nearest shopping malls / supermarkets to them and are able to schedule a shopping time based on the human traffic at the shop.
If the shop is fully booked for the time period the customer wants, they are redirected to the next nearest shop/mall. 

A customer is required to check in to a shop and check out of the same when done shopping. This is to help calculate the estimate human traffic in the 
shops at any given time.

Upon a successful scheduling, a shopping pass is printed for the customer and therefore security personell should allow a person to move freely within the
given window.
